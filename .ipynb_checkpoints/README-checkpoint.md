# United-States-Census-income-prediction
Build an efficient classification model to predict whether a person's yearly income is above $50k or not

## Introduction:
US Adult Census data which is used for this project has around 41 independent features such as Age, Education, race, occupation, age, native country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more. Each row is labelled as either having a salary greater than ">50K" or "<=50K".
- Raw data has lot of junk and missing values, so thorough exploration of training data is required before training the model

Details about the dataset is as below,

Training data:
    Number of records: 199523
    Number of Independent Features: 41
Validation data:
    Number of records: 99762
    Number of Independent Features: 41
